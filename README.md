![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f563299a-dc67-49ca-a251-5bdec448b083)

A comprehensive transistor-level design and simulation of a low-power **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** operating at **2.4 GHz**, implemented using **180nm CMOS technology** and verified via **LTspice**. The project aims at building a frequency synthesizer suitable for **ISM band** applications such as **Wi-Fi**, **Bluetooth**, and **ZigBee** transceivers.

## üìò Abstract

This project details the design and simulation of a fully integrated **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** that synthesizes a 2.4 GHz output from a 100 MHz reference using a divide-by-24 feedback loop. All sub-circuits including the **LC-based VCO**, **Phase Frequency Detector (PFD)**, **Charge Pump**, **Loop Filter**, and **Frequency Divider** are implemented at the transistor level using the 180nm technology node. The PLL is optimized for **low power consumption (6.36 mW)** and demonstrates stable locking characteristics with a control voltage of ~0.5 V.

## üîß Technologies Used

- CMOS 180nm Process Technology  
- LTspice for transistor-level simulation

## üìê PLL Architecture Overview

The PLL is composed of the following blocks:

1. **Phase Frequency Detector (PFD)**: Detects phase and frequency differences between reference and feedback signals using edge-triggered logic.  
2. **Charge Pump (CP)**: Converts digital UP/DN pulses from the PFD into current pulses.  
3. **Loop Filter (LF)**: Smooths the current from CP into a control voltage (Vctrl) using a 2nd order passive RC filter.  
4. **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)**: LC-based VCO using cross-coupled NMOS for negative resistance and MOS varactors for tuning.  
5. **Frequency Divider**: MOD-24 divider using cascaded MOD-6 and MOD-4 Johnson counters built with TSPC flip-flops.
